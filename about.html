					<p>
						Vinod George is a Mahwah, New Jersey native with a long-standing curiosity about patterns, numbers, and how data can tell meaningful stories. Growing up, data was not an abstract concept in his household. His father, a data scientist, played a central role in shaping Vinod's early exposure to analytical thinking and problem-solving, which naturally sparked his own interest in the field.
					</p>
					<p>
						From a young age, Vinod was drawn to sports, not just as a fan but as an observer of performance and statistics. He often found himself analyzing his favorite players' numbers, comparing seasons, and asking why certain trends emerged. This curiosity laid the foundation for his interest in using data to understand performance, decision-making, and outcomes.
					</p>
					<p>
						As his academic and technical interests developed, Vinod began to see data science as a bridge between logic and creativity. Beyond sports, he enjoys exploring how data science can intersect with other personal interests such as anime, mental health, and fashion. He is particularly interested in how data can be used to understand behavior, improve systems, and provide insight in areas that are both technical and deeply human.
					</p>
					<p>
						Vinod is currently focused on gaining hands-on experience through internships and real-world projects that allow him to apply analytical methods, machine learning, and data engineering concepts in practical settings. He is eager to learn, collaborate, and grow as a data scientist while continuing to refine both his technical skills and his ability to communicate insights clearly.
